# Code-Refactor
The Horizon social media web page is refactored on 07/07/2020 to meet web accessibilty standard. The CSS selectors and properties are consolidated, the semantic structure of the HTML elements is well organized, and comments are included before each element or section of the page.

# HTML semantic
The structure of the web page was in a sirios of divs, now it is organized into `header`, `nav`, `section`, `aside` and `footer`.

# CSS 
1. Selectors Used:- once the cleaned up the styling got easer to manuplate mainly the `header`, `section`, `aside` and `footer` followed by styling what ever is inside.
2. Sequential Order:- there was too much code writing `i.e 200 lines` and now it is cleaned up to `135 lines`.

# Tip
A reset code(`reset.css`) is added, this clear any existing styling to fit any computer machines follower by the `style.css`.
